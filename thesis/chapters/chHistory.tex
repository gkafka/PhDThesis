\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:HistIntro}

The neutrino was first postulated by Wolfgang Pauli as a possible explanation for the continuous spectrum of electrons emitted from nuclear $\beta$ decay \cite{ref:Pauli}. This decay was originally thought to be the emission of an electron from an atom, resulting in a different nucleus, via the process,
\beq
N \rightarrow N' + e
\label{eq:BetaWrong}
\eeq

\n where $N$ and $N'$ are the parent and daughter nuclei, respectively. In a two body decay such as this, the momenta and energies of the outgoing particles are exactly constrained. Pauli's new particle explained the continuous spectrum of electron energy via a modified decay process:
\beq
N \rightarrow N' + e + \nu
\label{eq:BetaRight}
\eeq

\n where $\nu$ is the outgoing neutral particle. Pauli's original proposal called the new particle the neutron, but this name was later used to name the massive neutral nucleon discovered by Chadwick in 1932 \cite{ref:Chadwick}. Three years after Pauli's idea, Fermi proposed a model for nuclear $\beta$ decay that included the new particle, which he coined the neutrino, or little neutral one \cite{ref:Fermi}.

\section{First Detection of Neutrinos}
\label{sec:1stDetection}

Twenty years passed from Fermi's model proposal before neutrinos were discovered experimentally. Fred Reines and Clyde Cowan made the discovery by placing a detector near a nuclear reactor as a source of neutrinos and observing inverse $\beta$ decay \cite{ref:1953, ref:1956}. The neutrinos observed were anti-electron neutrinos, thus the following was the observed process.
\beq
p + \anue \rightarrow n + e^{+}
\label{eq:BetaInv}
\eeq

\n Reines earned the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1995 for the detection of the neutrino.

In 1962, the muon neutrino was discovered at Brookhaven National Laboratory using the first neutrino beam \cite{ref:BNL} in a scheme still used in neutrino experiments today. The beam was generated by colliding protons with a target, producing pions that decayed into muons and muon neutrinos. The resultant beam then passed through thick steel, absorbing everything but the neutrinos. Leon Lederman, Melvin Schwartz, and Jack Steinberger won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1988 for the discovery of the muon neutrino.

The last generation of neutrino, the tau neutrino, was discovered at Fermilab by the DONUT collaboration in 2000 \cite{ref:DONUT}.

\section{Evidence of Neutrino Oscillations}
\label{sec:OscHist}

Pontecorvo first postulated neutrino oscillations between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos, analogous to $K^0/\bar{K}^0$ oscillations, in 1957 \cite{ref:Pontecorvo1}. Nothing came of the proposal immediately, but the idea was later revived and modified to solve the solar neutrino problem. The physics community initially viewed neutrino oscillations with skepticism and believed the experiments to be flawed, but over time oscillations have become an unmistakable and accepted phenomenon.

The solar neutrino problem was born from a large discrepancy between the theoretical and observed number of neutrinos produced by the sun. Neutrinos were used as a study for solar models because photons take a thousand years to escape the dense nuclear plasma to the surface of the sun, but neutrinos are unimpeded. The models, which have been confirmed today, describe a somewhat complicated chain of nuclear reactions, many of which produce neutrinos. Each individual process contributes a neutrinos in a different energy spectrum, but all of the neutrinos are created as electron neutrinos.

The experimental observations and theoretical predictions were both published in 1968. Ray Davis designed an experiment underground in the South Dakota Homestake mine consisting of a tank of an ultra pure chlorine cleaning solution capable of neutrino capture via the process
\beq
\nue +\mbox{ \textsuperscript{37}Cl }\rightarrow\mbox{ \textsuperscript{37}Ar }+ e^{-}
\label{eq:DavisExp}
\eeq

\n The argon atoms could be collected and counted for a direct measurement of the neutrino flux \cite{ref:Davis}. Meanwhile, John Bahcall precisely calculated the expected neutrino flux \cite{ref:Bahcall}, and the observed rate was found to be about one third of the predicted rate. Pontecorvo revived his theory with the modification of allowing $\nue$ to $\numu$ oscillations \cite{ref:Pontecorvo2}, but the idea was still not taken seriously and it was another 20 years before the solar neutrino problem was confirmed. 

Beginning in 1989, multiple experiments with different methodologies confirmed the solar neutrino problem. Kamiokande, a water Cherenkov detector, measured a rate deficit in 1989 \cite{ref:Kamiokande}. Two experiments measured solar neutrinos via the reaction
\beq
\nue + \mbox{ \textsuperscript{71}Ga } \rightarrow \mbox{ \textsuperscript{71}Ge } + e^{-}
\label{eq:GaExp}
\eeq

\n and measured a similar deficit, SAGE in 1991 \cite{ref:SAGE} and GALLEX in 1992 \cite{ref:GALLEX}. With results from three different experimental methods all showing similar rate deficits, the solar neutrino problem could no longer be relegated to an experimental error.

Evidence soon emerged for oscillations with atmospheric neutrinos as well. These neutrinos are produced when cosmic rays collide with particles in the atmosphere and decay, predominantly via the following channels.
\beqa
\pi^{+/-} & \rightarrow & \mu^{+/-} + \numu/\anumu \nonumber \\
\mu^{+/-} & \rightarrow & e^{+/-} + \nue/\anue + \anumu/\numu
\label{eq:AtmNu}
\eeqa

\n Thus, the expected ratio of muon family neutrinos to muon family neutrinos was expected to be 2. Kamiokande measured this ratio in 1992 and found the ratio to be much closer to 1 \cite{ref:KamioAtm}. Furthermore, the ratio seemed to be dependent on zenith angle, with the measurement being nearly 2 for neutrinos coming from directly overhead, and dropping as the angle increased. Super-Kamiokande (or Super-K), the successor to Kamiokande, improved upon this measurement in 1998 \cite{ref:SuperKAtm}, providing the most definitive evidence of neutrino oscillations to that point.

A resolution to the solar neutrino problem did not have to wait much longer with detector technologies capable of discerning different neutrino interaction types. SNO was designed as a heavy water (D\textsubscript{2}O) Cherenkov detector experiment to be sensitive to both the flux of electron neutrinos and the flux of all neutrinos. In 2002, it released results for these measurements, finding what was then the expected deficit in electron neutrino flux, but a total flux consistent with the standard solar model, see figure\ref{fig:SNO} \cite{ref:SNO02}. With this result, neutrino oscillations were confirmed, and subsequent experiments now measure oscillation parameters with precision.

The blue band represents neutral current scattering off of the deuterium nucleus, an interaction sensitive to the total neutrino flux. The green band represents elastic scattering of the neutrino off the deuterium electron, an interaction sensitive to all neutrino flavors, but not completely independent of neutrino flavor. The dashed straight lines represent the flux prediction by the standard solar model. The point represents the best fit for the flux of electron neutrinos and the flux for the combined muon and tau neutrinos.

\section{Possible Evidence of Sterile Neutrinos}
\label{sec:SterHist}

Several experiments have reported results that can be explained by oscillations between more than three neutrinos. The frequency of oscillations is controlled by the mass splitting between neutrino mass states, $\Delta m^2$, and will be considered in more detail in chapter~\ref{ch:Theory}. Historically, solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations were discovered first and were well explained by oscillations between the standard model's three active neutrinos, and with three neutrinos, there are only two independent mass splittings. Furthermore, it is known that there can only be three active neutrinos. However, there have been some experimental results that cannot be explained by oscillations based on the solar and atmospheric mass splitting scales, but they can be explained by oscillations based on a third independent mass splitting.

The number of active neutrinos is constrained by measurements of the width of the Z boson. LEP has measured the number of active neutrinos to be $2.984 \pm 0.008$ \cite{ref:LEP}, so the discoveries of the $\nue$, $\numu$, and $\nutau$ leave no room for new active neutrinos. Strictly speaking, there could be other active neutrinos if they had mass greater than half the mass of the Z boson so the Z could not decay to them, but while current evidence hinting at a sterile neutrino would suggest a mass splitting much larger than the solar and atmospheric scales, it is still much smaller than the mass of the Z.

The first evidence for an additional neutrino came from the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector, or LSND, in 1995. This experiment searched for $\anue$ appearance in a $\anumu$ beam. When it found an excess of events, it reported a measurement of a mass splitting between neutrino states $\Delta m^2$ of $O(1\evsq)$ \cite{ref:LSND}, a measurement incompatible with the mass splittings measured in both the atmospheric and solar oscillation experiments, suggesting the addition of at least one more neutrino. However, based on the result from LEP, this new neutrino cannot couple to the Z boson, hence the suggestion for a sterile neutrino.

Searches for sterile neutrinos can be categorized in one of three channels: $\nuanu_{\mu} \rightarrow\,\nuanu_{e}$ appearance, $\nuanu_{e}$ disappearance, and $\nuanu_{\mu}$ disappearance. The LSND result was from the appearance channel. The MiniBooNE experiment at Fermilab searched for both $\nue$ appearance in a $\numu$ beam and $\anue$ appearance in an $\anumu$ beam. While they first reported no event excess in 2007 \cite{ref:Mini2007}, their more results show excesses in both modes \cite{ref:Mini2013} that could be consistent with some sterile neutrino models. Not all experiments have found evidence of sterile neutrinos, however. The most recent results from KARMEN in 2002 \cite{ref:KARMEN} and NOMAD in 2003 \cite{ref:NOMAD}, both measuring the appearance channel, showed no evidence of oscillations at the same mass scale as LSND.

Experiments measuring the $\nuanu_{e}$ disappearance channel have also reported some indication for a neutrino at the same mass scale as the appearance channel. The so-called Gallium anomaly comes from a measured deficit of events in GALLEX \cite{ref:GALLEXSterile} and Sage \cite{ref:SageSterile} when placing a radioactive source inside the detectors for detector response measurements. On the other hand, reactor experiments such as Bugey \cite{ref:Bugey} reported no oscillations and RENO \cite{ref:RENO} and Daya Bay \cite{ref:DayaSterile} reported only oscillations consistent with standard three flavor oscillations. Furthermore, T2K, an accelerator experiment not unlike \nova, performed a short baseline analysis at its Near Detector and also found no evidence of sterile oscillations at $95\%$ confidence.

To date, experiments probing the $\nuanu_{\mu}$ disappearance channel have universally shown no evidence of sterile neutrinos. This includes an atmospheric neutrino measurement by Super-K \cite{ref:SuperKSterile} and a long baseline analysis by MINOS \cite{ref:MINOSSterile}. This list of experimental evidence for sterile neutrinos (or lack thereof) is not intended to be exhaustive, but it should be clear that there is not yet a scientific consensus on the existence of sterile oscillations despite the variety of past and current searches.

\nova~is a long baseline neutrino experiment with a near detector, thus capable of performing both short baseline and long baseline sterile neutrino analyses; this dissertation focuses on the long baseline. It measures events generated by the NuMI beam, a mostly pure $\numu$ beam, and thus measures the $\numu$ disappearance channel. (In the future, the beam will switch to $\anumu$ allowing for measurement in the $\anumu$ disappearance channel.) The analysis presented here searches for a deficit in the number of neutral current events at the far detector, using the near detector data to constrain the predicted spectrum. Neutral currents are insensitive to the flavors of the standard 3 active neutrinos, so a rate deficit would point to the existence of oscillations between active and sterile neutrinos.

This is a lengthy caption and it clearly would not fit on the same page as the figure. Note that you should only use the FPfigure command in instances where the figure really is too large. If the figure is small enough to fit by the caption than it does not produce the desired effect. Good luck with your thesis. I have to keep writing this to make the caption really long.
